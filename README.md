# Single and multiple phenotype QTL analyses of downy mildew resistance in interspecific grapevines
This repository contains the genetic and phenotypic data and code used in a recently accepted paper (link coming soon) in the Theoretical and Applied Genetics journal.

The genetic maps used in the analyses were initially generated by [Hyma et al. (2015)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134880) using the 12X.0 version of the grapevine genome. The 12x0_to_12x2conversion folder in the repository contains the necessary information to convert between the 12X.0 physical locations of SNPs and the 12X.2 (current genome version) physical locations of SNPs.
