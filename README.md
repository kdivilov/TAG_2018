# Single and multiple phenotype QTL analyses of downy mildew resistance in interspecific grapevines
This repository contains the genetic and phenotypic data and code used in a recently accepted paper (link coming soon) in the Theoretical and Applied Genetics journal.

The genetic maps used in the analyses were initially generated by [Hyma et al. (2015)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134880) using the 12X.0 version of the grapevine genome. The 12x0_to_12x2_conversion folder in the repository contains the necessary information to convert between the 12X.0 physical locations of SNPs and the 12X.2 (current genome version) physical locations of SNPs. In the genetic maps, 1 represents the heterozygous allele and 2 the homozygous allele. Further, chromosomes 1 through 19 represent chromosomes 1 through 19 in the maternal genetic map, and chromosomes 20 to 38 represent chromosomes 1 through 19 in the paternal genetic map.
